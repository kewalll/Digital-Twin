# Digital-Twin
Digital twins are a revolutionary concept that has emerged from industries such as aerospace and manufacturing. They provide virtual replicas of physical assets or systems, which are synchronized with real-time data from sensors and IoT devices. By harnessing advanced technologies like IoT, AI, and big data analytics, digital twins enable organizations to monitor, analyze, and simulate in real-time. This empowers them to optimize operations, improve decision-making, and drive innovation across various sectors including healthcare, transportation, and smart cities. With their ability to bridge the gap between the physical and  digital realms, digital twins have the potential to transform industries by enabling personalized treatments, predictive interventions, and efficient infrastructure management. This marks the beginning of a new era of digital transformation and efficiency
### DApps 
Decentralized applications (DApps) epitomize the diverse applications of blockchain technology. Operating on blockchain platforms like Ethereum, these applications function without a central governing body, utilizing smart contracts - self-executing contracts with predetermined rules embedded on the blockchain. DApps inherit the characteristics of blockchain, including transparency, immutability, and security, providing a broad spectrum of services ranging from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to gaming, social media platforms, and identity verification systems. 
### Software Tool Platform / Tools / Framework used 
- Zbyte: A platform that provides everything needed to build, deploy, and operate dApps. 
- IPFS: All the user documents are uploaded to the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a 
decentralized file system. 
- Cloudflare: Documents uploaded to the IPFS are fetched using the Cloudflare IPFS 
gateway to reduce document access time. 
- Smart Contracts (NFT Minter): Used for user-authentication, file tokenization and saving 
file to IPFS with userâ€™s wallet address. 
- Javascript: Used to handle the required backened-related operations throughout our dApp.

### Functional requirements 
- Document Upload: Users must have the capability to securely upload digital documents to the platform. 
- Digital Twin Creation: Once a document is uploaded, the system must automatically generate a digital twin of the document using blockchain technology. 
- Ownership Tracking: The system must transparently track changes in document ownership by utilizing the immutable ledger of blockchain. 
- Authenticity Verification: Users should have the ability to verify the authenticity of documents through verification mechanisms based on blockchain.
